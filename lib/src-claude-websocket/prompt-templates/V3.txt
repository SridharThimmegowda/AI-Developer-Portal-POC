3. **Execution Steps:**
   Original insiration name: Excessive hours
   Expected/migrated idea name: Excess Hours Worked Control

   Original insiration Description:
      Identify excessive hours worked by employees where the Actual time worked exceeds the Scheduled time worked
   Expected/migrated idea Description:
       Compare employees' scheduled hours to actual hours worked to identify instances where employees are working in excess of what they were scheduled. Instances of excess hours worked may indicate issues with the scheduling data or may indicate improper inflation of work hours by employees.

   Original insiration Steps to execute:
      Identify time and attendance transaction variances where Actual Time Worked exceeds Scheduled Time Worked based on a Percentage Variance on scheduled hours per employee.
   Expected/migrated idea Steps to execute:
      To check for employees working excess hours:
         (1) Determine the employee classification to be tested based on review of related company policy (i.e., Full Time Non-Exempt Employees). Other classifications can and should be tested separately by applying a similar approach.
         (2) Work with HR obtain an excerpt of the Employee Master file containing employee number, employee classification, employee name, employee’s department, employee’s manager. 
         (3) Work with HR to obtain a file containing the Scheduled Work Hours information for the period under review. Be sure the file includes the scheduled work date, employee number, employee name, and scheduled hours.
         (4) Work with HR to obtain a file containing the Actual Hours Worked information for the period under reivew. Be sure the file includes the actual work date, employee number, employee name, and actual hours.
         (5) Using the Employee Master file, apply a filter to isolate all employees matching the classification to be tested (i.e., Full Time Non-Exempt Employees). Output the filtered records to a file named Classified Employees.
         (6) Join the Classified Employees file with the Schedule Work Hours file on employee number. Be sure to include all fields from both files. Name the output Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees.
         (7) If the scheduled period for the employee classification being tested is daily continue with step 8. However, if the scheduled period is something other than daily, you will need to align the information in the Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees file with the related time period (i.e., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly). 
         (a) If the scheduled period is weekly or bi-weekly, do the following:
         (i) Create an Excel file listing the period number and calendar dates when each period begins and ends. (ii) Once created, import the file and name it Scheduled Periods. 
         (iii) In the Scheduled Periods file, create a computed field that concatenates the character version of the  beginning and ending date ranges for each scheduled period (i.e., 2/4/2024 - 2/10/2024) . Use the DATE() function to convert the beginning and ending dates to character strings. Upon completion, the Scheduled Periods file should contain a period number, beginning date, ending date, and the period date range. 
         (iv) In the Scheduled Periods file and the Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees file, create a computed field named Unique_Key and assign a value of 1. 
         (v) Join the Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees file with the Scheduled Periods file on Unique_Key. Be sure to include all secondary matches and include all fields from both files. Name the output Temp_Scheduled_Work_Hours. 
         (vi) In the Temp_Scheduled_Work_Hours file, apply a filter using the BETWEEN() function to isolate all records where the Scheduled Work Date falls between the Beginning Date and Ending Date. This adds the period information to each record, which facilitates summarizing scheduled work hours by period. Extract the filtered records to a file named Scheduled Work Hours with Period Info.
         (vii) Using the Scheduled Work Hours with Period Info file, summarize on period number and employee number, subtotal on scheduled work hours, and include employee name, beginning date, ending date, and period date range as other fields. Name the output Scheduled Work Hours by Period.
         (b) If the schedule period is monthly, do the following:
         (i) Create a computed field named Period in the Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees file  using the CMOY() function to convert the scheduled work date to its respective month name (i.e., January, February, etc.). If the period under review is a single calendar year, then each month name will be a distinct period. However, if the period under review spans multiple years, you may need to concatentate the year to the month name to generate unique period values. You can use the YEAR() function in conjunction with the STRING() function to extract the year from the scheduled work date and convert it to a character value that can be concatenated with the month name.
         (ii) Using the Scheduled Work Hours for Classified Employees file, summarize on period and employee number, subtotal on scheduled work hours, and include employee name as an other field. Name the output Scheduled Work Hours by Period.
         (8) If the scheduled period for the employee classification being tested is daily, use the Scheduled Work Hours by Classified Employee file for this step. If the scheduled period is something other than daily, use the Scheduled Work Hours by Period file for this step. If company policy dictates a specific limit on the scheduled hours for the employee classification being tested, apply a filter to isolate all instances where an employee has been scheduled for more than the expected scheduled hours (e.g., Scheduled Hours > Scheduled Hours Limit). The resulting records are instances of employees being scheduled for more hours than what is expected as per policy. Follow-up on these instances as needed.  
         (9) Join the Classified Employees file from step 5 above with the Actual Hours Worked file on employee number. Be sure to include all fields from both files in the output named Actual Hours Worked for Classified Employees.
         (10) If the scheduled period for the employee classification being tested is daily continue with the next step. However, if the scheduled period is something other than daily, you will need to align the information in the Actual Hours Worked for Classified Employees file with the related time period (i.e., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly). You can do so by following the approach in step 7 by replacing references to the Scheduled Work Hours by Classified Employee file with the Actual Hours Worked by Classified Employee file. 
         (11) If the scheduled period for the employee classification being tested is daily, join the Scheduled Work Hours by Classified Employee file on employee number and scheduled work date to the Actual Hours Worked by Classified Employee file on employee number and actual work date capturing all primary matches. Output the results to a file named Scheduled Versus Actual. Using the Scheduled Versus Actual file, apply a filter to isolate all instances where an employee has worked more hours than what they were scheduled (e.g., Scheduled Hours > Actual Hours Worked). The resulting records are instances of employees working more hours than what they were scheduled.  Follow-up on these instances as needed.    
         (12) If the scheduled period is something other than daily, join the Scheduled Work Hours by Period file on employee number and period to the Actual Hours Worked by Period file on employee number and period capturing all primary matches. Output the results to a file named Scheduled Versus Actual. Using the Scheduled Versus Actual file, apply a filter to isolate all instances where an employee has worked more hours than what they were scheduled (e.g., Scheduled Hours > Actual Hours Worked). The resulting records are instances of employees working more hours than what they were scheduled.  Follow-up on these instances as needed. 
         (13) Repeat the above steps to test other employee classifications.
         Use of the following ACL commands, functions and/or code samples may help with the analysis:
         - CDOW() function
         - CMOY() function
         - YEAR() function
         - STRING() function
         - DATE() function
         - BETWEEN() function
         - EXTRACT command
         - JOIN command

   Original insiration Considerations:
      Depending on company policies, you may also have different standards of Scheduled Time based on employee classification. Ensure employees are also not being scheduled for excessive hours.
   Expected/migrated idea Considerations:
      - Review company policy to determine differences in standards for Scheduled Time across employee classifications (i.e., Full time vs Part time, Exempt/Salaried vs Non-Exempt/Hourly, etc.). Also obtain an understanding of the scheduling time periods (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) as this will be used in the analysis.
      - You may want to consider excluding Exempt/Salaried employees, especially if they are not required to punch in. Typically, the hours worked by an exempt employee are not limited. 
      - You may want to consider testing different groups of employees based on their classification (i.e., Full time vs Part time) given that the related standards may differ. This will simplifyy the analysis to be performed. 
      - To provide additional context to any identified instances of excess hours, work with your HR team to obtain an excerpt of the Employee Master file containing employee number, employee classification, employee name, employee’s department, employee’s manager. This information will facilitate your ability to follow-up on any noted exceptions. 
      - The occurrence of employees with excess hours worked may not necessarily be indicative of fraudulent activity. A more detailed investigation of each instance, along with review of related activity is required. 

   Original insiration Example: 
      Management scheduled an employee to work 30 hours per week, but it seems the employee has been consistently punching in a minimum of 40 hours per week for the last year. Is this an issue with the accuracy of the scheduled hours, or is the employee inflating their actual time worked?
   Expected/migrated idea Example:
      In reviewing time and attendance logs, we noted that Employee #4152 in the warehouse was scheduled for an average of 30 hours per week over the last quarter. However, he punched an average of 45 hours per week, a 50% variance. His supervisor was unaware of the overtime and could not explain the variance, as extra hours were not approved. This appears to be a case of the employee inflating his hours worked and will require further investigation and potential disciplinary action.
   
   
   Use the following example as guidance to refine the provided description:
   "Analyze T&E transactions to identify duplicate expense claims where an employee has submitted the same expense more than once. The presence of duplicate expense claims could result in duplicate payments, and may be indicative of fraud."

   Use the following example as guidance to refine the provided steps_to_execute:
      To check for duplicate expenses:
         - Sort the expense details file by employee ID, merchant, expense amount, and expense date fields.
         - Use the DUPLICATES command to check for exact duplicates on the employee ID, merchant, expense amount, and expense date fields.
         - Duplicate expenses will have the same primary fields but may have the same or different values for reimbursement type. In addition, they can be submitted on different reports. Be sure to review these patterns for any reported duplicate instances. 
         - To supplement the information relating to the reported duplicate instances, join the duplicate expense file to the expense reports and employee files as follows:
         - Join the duplicate expense file to the employee file on employee number and include all fields from both files in the output. 
         - Take the joined file in step (a) above and join it to the expense reports file on expense report number and include all fields from both files in the output. 
         - Follow-up on the reported duplicate instances as needed.  
         - Sort the expense details file by employee number, expense amount, and expense date fields.
         - Use the DUPLICATES command to check for exact duplicates on the employee number, expense amount, and expense date fields.
         - Repeat step (4) above for any reported duplicate instances that weren't already reported in step (2) above.
         - There are several code samples listed below that can facilitate iterations of testing for duplicates and testing for near duplicates. 

      Use of the following ACL commands, functions and/or code samples may help with the analysis:
      - DUPLICATES command
      - SORT command
      - JOIN command
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Amount (Monetary Unit Variance) Multiple Key Fields code sample
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Amount (Monetary Unit Variance) Single Key Field code sample
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Amount (Percent Variance) Multiple Key Fields code sample
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Amount (Percent Variance) Single Key Field code sample
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Field - Multiple Key Fields code sample
      - Duplicates - Same Keys Different Field - Single Key Field code sample
      - Near Duplicates - Dice Coefficient code sample

   Use the following example as guidance to refine the provided considerations:
      Understand how your organization’s T&E files are structured. There may be an Expense Reports file containing higher level expense report information (i.e., expense report number, employee number, expense report date, expense report amount, etc.) In addition, there may be an Expense Details file containing the related expense detail (i.e., expense report number, employee number, merchant name, expense date, expense amount, expense type, method of payment, etc.). 

      Refer to your organization's T&E policy to determine acceptable methods of payment for expenses. Typical methods of payment include corporate credit card, personal credit card, cash, etc.  

      If employees travel globally, the Expense Details file may contain multiple expense amount fields – one to capture the amount in the transaction currency, and another that applies a fixed currency to align transaction amounts to the same corporate currency. This analytic identifies duplicate expenses by matching expense amounts. Be sure to use the fixed currency expense amount field when executing the analytic.  

      To provide additional context to any identified duplicate expenses, work with your HR team to obtain an excerpt of the Employee Master file containing employee number, employee name, employee’s department, employee’s manager. This information will facilitate your ability to follow-up on any noted exceptions. 

      When testing for duplicates expenses, there are two basic approaches: (1) Testing for exact duplicates, and (2) Testing for near duplicates. Testing for both exact and near duplicates can help maximize coverage.

      ACL's Duplicates command does an excellent job of testing for exact duplicates. It can help identify all instances where the primary expense fields (employee number, merchant, expense date, and expense amount) have in fact been duplicated. The presence of duplicate invoices increases the risk of having duplicate payments.

      Testing for near duplicates requires a bit more effort, and is where the more extensive testing takes place. These types of tests allow for slight variations in the values of the primary expense fields to identify near duplicates. 

      The identification of duplicate expenses is an iterative process. The first suggested test checks for exact duplicates across primary expense fields: same employee ID, merchant, expense date, and expense amount. The second test simply drops the merchant from the test. There are many other iterations that can be applied for duplicate expense testing, such as: 
      - Same employee and merchant
      - Same employee, merchant, and expense amount
      - Same employee, expense amount, expense date, and different reimbursement type
      - Different employee, same expense amount and expense date
      - Different employee, same merchant and same expense amount

The occurrence of duplicate expense may not necessarily be indicative of fraudulent activity. A more detailed investigation of each duplicate instance, along with review of related expense activity is required.
