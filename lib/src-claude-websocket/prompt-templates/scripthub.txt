3. **Guidelines for Migration from ScriptHub to Code Samples:**
   - SCRIPTHUB_NAME
      a. Goal: Transform the ScriptHub name into a concise, descriptive name that clearly communicates the script's purpose or functionality.
      b. Steps for Transformation:
         i. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary for understanding.
         ii. Ensure the name reflects the primary action or analysis performed by the script.
         iii. Use action-oriented terms like "Analyze," "Generate," or "Compare" to convey purpose.
   - DESCRIPTION
      a. Goal: Expand and refine the description to clarify the script’s purpose and provide context for its application.
      b. Steps for Transformation:
         i. Specify what the script achieves and the scenarios where it is useful.
         ii. Highlight key features and advantages of the script.
         iii. Make the description detailed enough to provide a clear understanding but concise enough to be easily readable.
         iv. Avoid vague terms; use precise language to describe functionality and output.
   - PREREQUISITES
      a. Goal: Simplify and clarify the prerequisites for executing the script.

   - OUTPUT
      a. Goal: Provide a detailed overview of the output generated by the script and its significance.
      b. Steps for Transformation:
         i. Clearly list all output tables, fields, or results produced by the script.
         ii. Explain the meaning of each field or component of the output.
         iii. Specify sorting, formatting, or additional details that enhance usability.
         iv. Use examples to demonstrate the output's structure and relevance to the task.

4. **Execution Steps:**
   **Samples Data for Execution consideration**
   
   **Sample-1**
   - **Original ScriptHub Name:** Text Analysis - All Words  
   - **Migrated code_samples Name:** Text Analysis - All Words

   - **Original Description:**
      Lists all words appearing in a specified field in separate records, and the count and percentage occurrence of the first letter, first two letters, last letter, and last two letters.
   - **Migrated Description:**
       Creates an Analytics table with all unique words found in a user-specified field, showing the count and percentage of occurrence of each word. Creates additional Analytics tables with the count and percentage of occurrence of the leading letter, leading letter pair, last letter, and last letter pair.

   - **Original Prerequisites:**
      - An ACL table with at least one text field.
      - Script developed using functionality available in Analytics: 11
      - This script can support text analysis such as expected versus actual occurrence of first or last letter frequency.
   - **Migrated Prerequisites:**
      - Analytics table with a character field to process.

   - **Original Limitations:**
      - A single character field can be tested at a time.
      - To run this analysis on more than one character field, run the script multiple times or append the character fields.
      - For multiple runs, consider declaring different output table names to prevent overwriting of previous results.
      - The script removes non-alphabetic characters such as numbers or punctuation from the text field. This step ensures that words that may or may not contain punctuations, such as “cooperation” and “co-operation” are counted as the same word.
      - The script converts all text to upper case.
      - This script is limited to processing characters from the English alphabet.
   - **Migrated Limitations:**
      - The analysis is not case sensitive. All text is converted to upper case before further processing.
      - The script has been configured for characters A to Z. All other characters including numbers and punctuation are stripped from the text. To process other characters, modify variable v_alphabet as needed.
      - A single character field can be processed at a time.
      - To produce a combined analysis for multiple fields in the same table, consider concatenating multiple fields in a computed field, then run the script on the computed field.
      - To produce a separate analysis for different fields in the same table, consider running the script multiple times on each of the required fields. Extract the results to a new table for every script run to avoid overwriting previous results.
      - By default, the script processes all words in the specified field.
      - To exclude specific words, modify variable v_exclude as instructed in the script.
      - To only include words with a minimum number of characters, modify variable v_min_length as instructed in the script.
      - The script inserts carriage return/line feed (CRLF) characters into every blank space between words, which temporarily increases the length of the input field. For a very long input field, this may result in a maximum record length error, especially if the input field contains a large number of short words and spaces. No generic workaround is available for this rare scenario.

   - **Original Steps to run:** 
      The following variables are used by this script and need to be initialized before the first run.
         - v_input_table = The prepared ACL table to process
         - v_test_field = The character field to process
         - v_output_table = The desired name of the output table, max length: 27 characters to accommodate suffix.
         To initialize the variables, import the script into your ACL project, and then edit the variable input as necessary before running the script.
         - ASSIGN v_input_table  = 'Input_Table'
         - ASSIGN v_test_field   = 'Description'
         - ASSIGN v_output_table = 'Output_Table'
         - DO SCRIPT All_Words
   - **Migrated Steps to run:**
      - Download the code sample from the Developer Portal.
      - In the Analytics project, right-click any folder in the Navigator panel, select Import Project Items >> Script and navigate to the location of the aclscript file downloaded from the Developer Portal.
      - Open the imported script. In the Variable Configuration section, read all notes (if provided) and modify all variables as described in each variable's comment.
      - Click the Run button in the script's button bar.

   - **Original Output:** 
      - An ACL table with the user provided output table name, with suffix All, containing all distinct words from the input table.
      - Field Clean_Words shows each distinct word, without punctuation, numbers, special characters, and converted to upper case.
      - Field First_Letter, First_2_Letters, Last_Letter, and Last_2_Letters contain the corresponding letters for further analysis.
      - An ACL table with the user provided output table name, with suffix F1, containing the actual count and percentage distribution of all possible first letters. Sorted in descending order on Count.
      - Field First_Letter shows all possible first letters in the English alphabet.
      - Field Count shows the number of times that letter appeared in the distinct words.
      - Field Percentage shows the percentage distribution of that letter in the distinct words.
      - An ACL table with user provided output table name, with suffix F2, containing the actual count and percentage distribution of all possible first two letter pairs. Sorted in descending order on Count.
      - Same fields as in the First Letter table above.
      - ACL tables with the user provided output table names and suffix L1 and L2, containing the same fields as F1 and F2, but for the last letter and last 2 letter pairs.
   - **Migrated Output:**
      - Analytics table R_{input_table_name}_All lists all unique words found in the character field across all records, sorted in descending order on count and percentage of occurrence. Lists the leading character, leading character pair, trailing character, and trailing character pair.
      - Analytics table R_{input_table_name}_F1/F2/L1/L2, showing the leading and trailing characters and character pairs respectively, along with the count and percentage of occurrence. Includes characters and character pairs not found in the text.

   **Sample-2**
   - **Original ScriptHub Name:** Unexpected Activity - After Cut-off Date  
   - **Migrated code_samples Name:** Unexpected Activity - Multiple Key Fields

   - **Original Description:**
      Compares dates in a transaction table to cut-off dates in a master table, and reports any transactions that have occurred after the cut-off date.
   - **Migrated Description:**
       Compares dates in a transaction table to the corresponding cut-off date in a master table, and reports transactions that have occurred after the cut-off date or for which no cut-off date was found. The corresponding cut-off date for a transaction can be found in the master table by joining on one or more common (key) fields. This script is intended for scenarios where there are different cut-off dates for different values in the key field(s).

   - **Original Prerequisites:**
      - A transaction table with the required key fields and a date field to compare to the master table.
      - A master table with the required key fields and a date field to compare to the transaction table.
      - For example, in a table containing payroll transactions, compare the Payment Date to the Termination Date in the HR Master table to identify employees that were paid after the termination date.
      - The transaction table and the master table will be joined on the specified number of left-most fields in both tables.
      - The key fields to group by must be the left-most fields in both tables.
      - If only a single key field is needed, and it is not the left-most field in the table, consider using ScriptHub script Unexpected Activity - After Cut-Off Date - Single Field, which supports joining the two tables on the specified single fields regardless of their positions in the table layout.
      - Script developed using functionality available in Analytics: 11.4
   - **Migrated Prerequisites:**
      - Transaction table with the required key field(s) and a date field. For example: Payroll date by department and employee.
      - Master table with the corresponding key field(s) and a cut-off date field. For example: HR master with termination date by department and employee.

   - **Original Limitations:**
      - This script expects a many to one join on the key fields, i.e. the same single cut-off date applies to all transactions sharing the same keys.
   - **Migrated Limitations:**
      - Matching of the key field(s) in the transaction table with the master table is case-insensitive.
      - The key field(s) by which to group must be the leading (left-most) field(s) in both the transaction table and the master table. They must appear in the same order. If not already the case, extract the data to new tables, selecting the key field(s) first followed by all other fields.
         - Note: Code Sample Unexpected Activity - Single Key Field performs the same process for a single, named key field in the transaction and master tables, for example: Employee_ID. This Code Sample does not require the key field to be the leading (first) field in either table.
      - The master table is expected to have unique records by key field(s). If there are duplicate records sharing the same key field(s), only the first record is used to determine the cut-off date.

   - **Original Steps to run:** 
      The following variables are used by this script and need to be initialized before the first run.
         - v_input_table = The transaction table to process
         - v_input_table2 = The master table to process
         - v_key_num = The number of left-most key fields to join the tables on, applicable to both tables.
         - v_date1 = The date field in the transaction table to be compared to the cut-off date.
         - v_date2 = The date field in the master table to be compared to the transaction date.
         - v_output_table = The desired name of the output table, max length: 31 characters
      To initialize the variables, import the script into your ACL project, and then edit the variable input as necessary before running the script.
         - ASSIGN v_input_table  = 'Payroll_Data'
         - ASSIGN v_input_table2 = 'HR_Master'
         - ASSIGN v_key_num      = 2
         - ASSIGN v_date1        = 'Payment_Date'
         - ASSIGN v_date2        = 'Termination_Date'
         - ASSIGN v_output_table = 'R_Output_Table'
         - DO SCRIPT Unexpected_Activity
   - **Migrated Steps to run:**
      - Download the Code Sample from the Developer Portal.
      - In the Analytics project, right-click any folder in the Navigator panel, select Import Project Items >> Script and navigate to the location of the aclscript file downloaded from the Developer Portal.
      - Open the imported script. In the Variable Configuration section, read all notes (if provided) and modify all variables as described in each variable's comment.
      - Click the Run button in the script's button bar.

   - **Original Output:** 
      - An ACL table with the user provided output table name, showing records where the transaction date is later than the cut-off date, or, the cut-off date could not be determined as there was no match in the master file on the specified key fields.
      - All fields from both tables are extracted to the results.
      - Computed field Exception returns labels ‘Flagged’ or ‘No match found’.
      - Computed field Days_After shows the number of days between the cut-off date and the transaction date.
      - NOTE : Additional labels can be added to field Exceptions if needed, for example, ‘Within 15 days’ if the transaction date is within 15 days of the cut-off date. This maybe useful for profiling exceptions. For example, the last pay cycle for a terminated employee may legitimately fall within 15 days of termination.
      - NOTE : Days_After can be used to filter low risk exceptions, if transactions may legitimately occur within a few days of the cut-off date.
   - **Migrated Output:**
      - Analytics table R_{transaction_table_name} contains all records where the transaction date occurs after the corresponding cut-off date, or where the corresponding date in the master table is empty, or where no match for a given key was found in the master table.
      - The result table carries forward all fields from the transaction table, followed by fields Cutoff_Date, Exception, and Days_After.
         - Field Cutoff_Date shows the cutoff date from the master table, if available.
         - Field Exception displays the reason for flagging the record: Unexpected Activity, No cutoff date found in Master, or No match found in Master.
         - Days_After displays the number of days between the transaction date and the cut-off date. Where no cut-off date was found, displays 99999.
